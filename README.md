# The-Big-Race-Berkeley-vs.-Stanford-
2D Car Racing Game 🏎💨 

A dynamic 2D car racing game themed around the classic rivalry between Berkeley and Stanford, using Python.
Utilized the Pygame library to create immersive gameplay, GUI, and fluid in-game physics to simulate realistic collision angles and impacts.
Developed a real-time scoring system and a 10-level game progression by incrementally increasing the CPU's (Stanford's) velocity and acceleration parameters.
